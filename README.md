## **Overview**  
This repository contains the agent-based model, analysis, and outputs for the project:  

**Overcoming Inconvenience: How Society Can Incentivize Individual Recycling Behavior – An Agent-Based Model**  

This study uses an **agent-based model (ABM)** to analyze the factors that influence individual recycling behaviors at the community level. By simulating interactions between agents, the model investigates how incentives, opportunity cost, and social pressures can shift collective recycling practices.

## **Key Insights**  
- Agents’ recycling decisions are influenced by **peer pressure, rewards, and convenience**.  
- The **availability of recycling bins** and the perceived social credit of recycling play critical roles.  
- The ABM framework helps policy-makers identify **key incentives and relationships** to encourage community recycling.
